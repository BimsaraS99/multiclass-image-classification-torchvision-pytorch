# Multiclass Image Classification with PyTorch and TorchVision
This project demonstrates how to build and train a neural network model for multiclass image classification using PyTorch and TorchVision. The model is trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 grayscale images of clothing items divided into 10 classes.
