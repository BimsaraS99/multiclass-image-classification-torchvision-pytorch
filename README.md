# multiclass-image-classification-torchvision-pytorch
This project uses a deep learning model to classify fashion items from images in the Fashion-MNIST dataset. It employs a fully connected neural network with two hidden layers, trained using stochastic gradient descent and a cross-entropy loss function. The model achieves 87% accuracy on the test set.
